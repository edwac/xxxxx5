In a recent interview with CNBC, the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”This is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.”Wozniak also called for further regulation efforts, saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival.“Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.”<br><br><iframe width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" style="border:0" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyBjqGu_-hrPehMjzQOb0wzFZMj1mS8mW7A&q=Europe" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://helena.blob.core.windows.net/xxxx3/coingigant.html">#bitcoin, #blockchain, #cryptocurrencies, #currency, #mining, 2018, alt, altcoin, altcoins, best cryptocurrency, best ico, bitcoin cash, bitcoin news, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin miners decentralized, money making, digital currencies, digital trading, hashrates, trading exchanges. altcoin market,, boxmining, boxmining daily, Boxmining michael, btc, coin, coinbase, crypto, Crypto Daily, Crypto News, cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency news, eth, ethereum, ethereum news, exchange, ian balina, ico, ICO </a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
